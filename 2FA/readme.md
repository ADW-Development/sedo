# 2FA
Two-factor AUTH. something pretty important in just one case,

# What to do? When to do it?
If someone who does NOT have 2FA in the orginization that is fine.
But if someone who does NOT have 2FA and does not know about the scratch or does not have a scratch account, 
then you need to tell a manager and report the user right away, maybe even log it.
